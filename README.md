Most of my work focuses on backend systems, infrastructure tooling, and internal developer frameworks — the kind that make you faster, not fancier.

## Bio

Systems geek, terminal enthusiast, and firm believer that tools should stay out of your way.  
Collector of printed UNIX & programming books.  
Ideal weekend: silence, a clean terminal, and two sleeping kids.

Turned off syntax highlighting. On purpose. I don’t recommend it — but it’s mine.
