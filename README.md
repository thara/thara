- I use Go, Swift(outside of apple platform), Rust, Ruby, Python, Java, Kotlin, Dart, etc...
- I prefer Protocol Buffers and gRPC for protocols.
- I enjoy parallel programming, though I'm not sure if I excel at it.
- In addition to programming, I also enjoy domain modeling/data modeling, testing, and refactoring.
- I'm a Terminal enthusiast.
- Iâ€™m a believer in 'syntax highlighting off' (but I don't recommend it to others).
